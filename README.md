# Run.nvim
 
Run.nvim is a lightweight Neovim plugin that streamlines file operations within file explorers like Oil and netrw.
Inspired by the convenience of Emacsâ€™s Dired mode([dired-do-shell-command](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Commands-in-Dired.html)),
Run.nvim lets you quickly execute common file commands (such as extracting archives, changing permissions, or opening files) directly from your file browser.

## Features
   - Quick File Detection:
        * Retrieves the full path of the file or directory under the cursor with ease.
   - Predefined Commands:
        * Offers a set of ready-to-use commands like tar extraction, chmod +x, xdg-open, and more.
   - Custom Actions:
        * Easily configure your own commands using placeholders, making repetitive tasks faster and error-free.
   - Flexible Execution:
        * Choose to run commands synchronously, asynchronously, or even launch them in a terminal window, so you can tailor the workflow to your needs.


## Overview
Run.nvim aims to reduce context switching by integrating powerful file operations directly into your file explorer.
